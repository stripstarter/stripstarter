    <h3>What is Stripstarter?</h3>
    <br />
    <article class="post-content">
    <p><a href="http://stripstarter.org">Stripstarter</a> is a crowdfunding platform for media, notably pornography.</p>

<p>You can make and fund campaigns for photos or movies that don’t exist yet focused on anyone from a celebrity to your barista to even yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Let’s give a real-world example:</strong></p>

<p>Suppose you want to see pictures of that cute waitress, Jane Doe, in a bikini.  Create a campaign and give it a pledge, or contribute to an existing one; likewise, people may contribute to your campaign.  If the campaign succeeds, only the pledgers get the goods.</p>

<p><strong>What’s the likelihood of these campaigns actually working?</strong></p>

<p>Since you don’t get charged unless it actually comes to fruition, the only thing that browsing our site costs is your time.  It’s a pretty novel idea, too – one which might get media coverage.</p>

<p>If it does, people will invariably check the site to see if they’re on it.  Jane hears about Stripstarter and finds out that she can make $500 for a series of photographs.  Given enough campaigns, the odds are that a non-trivial number of them will become realized.</p>

<p><strong>Make a campaign for yourself!</strong></p>

<p>The highest likelihood of money changing hands comes from desirable people who know their comfort level and make a campaign espousing it.  Once the campaign reaches a level you’re happy with, simply submit the promise and receive the reward.</p>

<p>There can be multiple campaigns centered around the same person, each with different promises.  Contribute to one, many, or create a new one that suits your needs.</p>

<p><strong>Can I use it anonymously?</strong></p>

<p>Users who register as pledgers are anonymous: we keep information internally but there are no public data for your account.  Campaigns will list numbers of pledgers and contributions, but that’s it.</p>

<p>Performers have some public information associated with their account, such as their name.  In our example, Jane would be given an account automatically when her campaign was created.  If you wish to be removed from our site, we will do so immediately.</p>

<p><strong>Is this legal?</strong></p>

<p>We have absolutely no idea.  You’ll be the <s>first</s> second to know.</p>

<p><strong>Is this ethical?</strong></p>

<p>Pornography as a concept aside, the current practice and industry often violates free agency and dignity of those involved, and porn consumption can have its own domestic considerations that are not our place to address here.</p>

<p>However, by creating an inclusive crowdfunding platform we believe that the balance of power shifts closer to equality between the performer and consumer, and away from the practices of industry.</p>

<p>In our current model, we create personas for people who have not given their express consent.  While common practice among tech companies, we are trying to come up with an alternative solution that does not violate the dignity of those who do not wish to participate.</p>
