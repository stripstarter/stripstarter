THIS PAGE WILL LIST THE FEATURES AND AMOUNT FOR A PARTICULAR CAMPAIGN REFERENCED BY @campaign

IT IS ONLY ACCESSIBLE IF THE CURRENT USER IS A PERFORMER (OR ADMIN) WHO OWNS THE CAMPAIGN SPECIFIED.

THE FEATURES WILL ALL HAVE A LENGTHY DESCRIPTION OF WHAT EXACTLY IS REQUESTED (THE SAME DESCRIPTION THE PERSON MAKING THE CAMPAIGN WOULD SEE)

THERE WILL BE AN UPLOAD FORM WHICH POSTS TO PerformancePhotos#create WHICH SAVES THE ATTACHMENT VIA PAPERCLIP TO A PRIVATE FOLDER IN THE BUCKET.  THIS FORM IS INLINE AND THE POST REQUEST IS ASYNCHRONOUS.

ONCE THE PERFORMER HAS UPLOADED ENOUGH PHOTOS THEY FEEL IS SUFFICIENT, THEY CLICK 'Continue' WHICH MAKES A POST REQUEST TO Campaigns#submit_for_review.

FROM THERE, THE CAMPAIGN WILL BE MARKED AS "in_review" AND THERE WILL BE AN ADMIN INTERFACE TO REVIEW CAMPAIGNS AND MARK THEM AS "completed" OR BACK TO "active"
